<tr><td>2015-04-12 20:45:05</td><td>If Hillary Rodham Clinton gets her way, there will be stark differences between her failed 2008 run for president and the White House campaign she began Sunday - and not just the end result.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 20:45:05</td><td>This time: Only four uses of the word "I" as Clinton moves to make her campaign a communal effort, and one that focuses strongly on the economic unease that has persisted during the two terms of the man who defeated her in 2008, President Obama.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 20:45:05</td><td>Then an immediate segue to the campaign's economic underpinnings, in rhetoric more associated with Democrats such as fist-shaking populist Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, than Clinton.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-12 20:45:05</td><td>The video - let's face it, Clinton's first campaign ad - offers a reproach of that argument.</td></tr>
