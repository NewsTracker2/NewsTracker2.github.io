<tr><td>2015-04-05 16:06:10</td><td>Washington: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday again denounced the agreement between Tehran and world powers as a "bad deal" that "endangers" Israel and will leave Iran with a large nuclear infrastructure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-05 16:06:10</td><td>"It doesn't roll back Iran's nuclear program," Netanyahu said, one of several US networks he appeared on to slam the deal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-05 19:50:33</td><td>Israel's government reacted angrily to the historic agreement, which aims for a June 30 deadline for a final deal, with Netanyahu demanding that Iranian recognition of the Jewish state's right to exist be written into the agreement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-06 01:59:23</td><td>Relations between Israel and its traditionally staunch US ally are at a low and were hugely damaged when Netanyahu took the unprecedented step of addressing Congress last month to attack the nuclear negotiations with Iran.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-06 01:59:23</td><td>When asked if he trusts President Barack Obama, Netanyahu replied: "I trust that the president is doing what he thinks is good for the United States, but I think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this" because Iran has been shown not to be trustworthy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-04-06 02:01:33</td><td>Ben Rhodes, the US deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, said Netanyahu was wrong because no deal could be reached that involved Iran dismantling its nuclear program.</td></tr>
