<tr><td>2015-03-26 05:52:26</td><td>And now Zayn Malik and One Direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 05:52:26</td><td>Unlike Van Halen, which started over when it replaced Roth with a new lead singer (Sammy Hagar); or Oasis, which essentially disbanded when Gallagher left, One Direction is all vocalists, making it easier to absorb a loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 05:52:26</td><td>Cowell said in a statement Wednesday that One Direction fans "can rest assured that Niall, Liam, Harry and Louis are hugely excited about the future of the band."</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015-03-26 05:52:26</td><td>"Zayn's exit from One Direction is painful because it means something has ended, but it would have been vastly more painful to approach the next few months with a sense of unsteadiness," he says.</td></tr>

<tr><td>2015-03-26 06:09:15</td><td>One Direction formed in 2010 after five teenagers " Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Malik " auditioned individually for the British TV talent show "The X Factor."</td></tr>
